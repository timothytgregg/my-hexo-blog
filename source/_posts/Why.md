my friend cried out
he didn't need to say more
for I had seen the slashes on his wrist,
the alcohol, pornography,
and ssri's in his eyes,
thoughts of suicide.
I looked at him and he was me,
living a different life
so I answered his plea:
Life is like the best video game you will ever play
I mean look around,
you gotta admit,
the graphics are insane.
no need for controllers,
except for your brain.
never alone, 
and no level is ever the same.
but best of all,
you get to make love in this game.
though there will always be challenges,
boss battles make the game worth playing.
the obstacle's resistance, 
becomes the way to assist leveling you up. 
dragons make the heroes,
pressure makes the diamond,
the hottest fires forge the strongest steel,
and this — right now — will make you.
let me let you in on the secret.
the constituents of your consciousness
are ever harkening you
toward that which you came to learn,
and who you came to be,
but for these fine perceptions
you must make yourself fit.
you can choose
numbing yourself into oblivion
for a few hours,
or even a lifetime.
but when you return home
to that immaculate ground of being,
where there is no struggle,
no striving, no victory, and no pain
you'll miss the living hell outta this game.
so you'll court maya once more,
hoping that this time 
she wakes you up
and you can begin again unspooling
this beautiful thread of your karma.
but it won't be the same.
your dear ones will be others,
sisters, brothers.
and the way this world's leaning,
we might not be more others.
so come, come
whoever you are
wanderer, worshipper,
lover of leaving,
even if you have forsaken your vows
a thousand times,
ours is not a caravan of despair.
dreams do come true,
and nothing is impossible,
but be righteous
and remember god
in everything you do.
Aumen
