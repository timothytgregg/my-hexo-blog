Here’s an interesting passage I found in a book I’m reading about the importance of sleeping in total darkness and endogenous DMT production.
The premise is that the ancients seemed more in touch with God and had more visions than we do today because of endogenous DMT. Maybe Moses, Ezekiel, and Jesus had a greater rate of pineal DMT production than most.
When I asked Dennis McKenna, an ethnopharmacologist who has studied plant hallucinogens for more than 20 years, he responded: 
Cliff, I think it’s unlikely that, evolutionarily, we produce less DMT than our ancestors. But I think it’s more likely that our ancestors had an intrinsically higher level of pineal activity, because they did not live in an environment with artificial lighting. Light destroys melatonin, and melatonin is the pineal precursor to 5-MeO-DMT and pinoline, a ß-carboline that can shift serotonin metabolism toward the “methylation pathway” when it normally would be degraded by MAO (mono-amine oxidase). One reason modern man is so fucked up, in my opinion, is that we never experience true (absolute) darkness; so the pineal doesn’t work properly, we don’t sleep properly, and don’t have the rich dream life that supports that. So that may be one rationale to support your idea!
Recently I’ve been prioritizing the depth and quality of my sleep. Utter darkness, earplugs, Meditation, plenty of Magnesium, and a supplement containing GABA, 5-HTP, Melatonin, Passionflower, Skullcap, and Ashwagandha.
Deep, deep restorative sleep with dozens of dreams.
