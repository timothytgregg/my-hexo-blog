A lady at the gym today had a fit over me doing pancake good mornings barefoot.
She was severely disturbed and started hyperventilating.
"I don't want my hands to be touching where your bare feet have touched."
Why are some people so disturbed by feet?
I bet hers hadn't seen the light of day for years.

'Forget not that the Earth longs to feel your feet,
and the Wind delights to play with your hair'
--Kahlil Gibran

Da Vinci wrote that the human foot was the most magnificent structure in Nature.

Be proud of your feet.

--Timove
