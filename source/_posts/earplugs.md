I'm weird.
I wear earplugs everywhere I go.
Going to bed? Earplugs.
Going downtown? Earplugs.
Reading a book? Earplugs.
Working out? Earplugs.
They help me tune in to the wellspring of my self.
Planes fly over my house. Constant din and quiet roar.
I remember at Vanderbilt I moved in to a different dormitory because the hospital next door was too loud.
These industrial noises are not overwhelming, but they prevent attention to the quietest ripples rising up from your own bodily experience.
The way your blood rushes a little faster through your neck when you have one side of your face on the yoga mat than the other.
There are rooms that are utterly silent. Most humans cannot stand them. They start hearing their heartbeats. Their digestion. Their breath. The way their joints creak. Some say even all the way down to your DNA you can sense if you're sensitive enough.
I've never been in one of those rooms, but I think I would love to try it.
Your body communicates to you. 
You just have to listen.
