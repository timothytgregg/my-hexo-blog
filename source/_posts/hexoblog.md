# Using [Hexo](hexo.io), I've set up this blog so I *never* have to leave the command line to publish my thoughts to the Web.


## With just a few simple commands, I can make a new post, write it out, generate the templates, then deploy and push it to github.

1. Create new post
..* `hexo new hexoblog`
